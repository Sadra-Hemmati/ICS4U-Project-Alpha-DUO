## Project Overview

DUO is a game similar to UNO, but instead of screaming UNO when you have one card remaining, you must click a randomly placed pop-up before your opponent. This happens when you have two cards remaining, hence the name DUO. If you fail, you draw two cards, but if you react fast enough, you can go on and win! Games are one-on-one and can be played over LAN.

## Tools used

This project uses Kryonet to host games on LAN, and Swing to create the GUI.
